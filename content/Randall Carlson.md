Randall Carlson is an American researcher, geologist, and independent scholar known for his theories on catastrophic events and their impact on Earth's history and human civilization. He has a background in geology, architecture, and geomythology, and is particularly interested in the study of ancient cultures and the effects of natural disasters on human development.

Carlson gained prominence through his lectures, interviews, and collaborations with other researchers, such as Graham Hancock. He is a proponent of the idea that Earth has experienced numerous catastrophic events, such as comet impacts, massive floods, and other natural disasters, which have significantly influenced the course of human history. One of his main focuses is the study of the Younger Dryas period, a time of sudden climatic change around 12,800 years ago, which he believes was triggered by a comet impact.

Carlson's work often involves analyzing geological evidence, ancient myths, and historical records to support his theories. Like Hancock, he is a controversial figure, with critics arguing that his interpretations of evidence are speculative and not always supported by mainstream science. Nonetheless, his ideas have attracted a considerable following and have contributed to ongoing debates about the role of catastrophic events in shaping Earth's history and human civilization.
