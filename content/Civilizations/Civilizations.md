Here is a summary of some of the earliest known civilizations and peoples from around the world, recognized for their contributions to the development of human societies:

1. [[Sumerians]]: Emerging around 4500 BCE in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), the Sumerians are known for establishing one of the world’s first urban civilizations. They developed early writing systems, complex irrigation, and city-states such as Ur and Uruk.

2. Egyptians: Ancient Egypt, with its origins around 3100 BCE, is renowned for its advanced culture along the Nile River. The Egyptians are famous for their monumental architecture, including the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, as well as their contributions to writing, art, and governance.

3. **Indus Valley Civilization**: Flourishing around 3300 to 1300 BCE in what is now Pakistan and northwest India, the Indus Valley Civilization, including major cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, was notable for its advanced urban planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and undeciphered script.

4. **Minoans**: Existing from approximately 2700 to 1450 BCE on the island of Crete, the Minoans developed a complex society known for their elaborate palaces, such as Knossos, and significant contributions to early European art and trade.

5. **Mycenaeans**: From around 1600 to 1100 BCE in mainland Greece, the Mycenaeans are recognized for their fortified palace complexes, extensive trade networks, and contributions to early Greek culture, including influences on later Greek mythology and epic poetry.

6. **Chinese Xia Dynasty**: Traditionally dated from around 2070 to 1600 BCE, the Xia Dynasty is considered one of China’s earliest dynasties, though historical evidence is limited. It is thought to have laid the groundwork for subsequent Chinese dynasties and statecraft.

7. **Olmecs**: Known as one of the earliest Mesoamerican civilizations, the Olmecs flourished from approximately 1200 to 400 BCE in what is now southern Mexico. They are credited with the creation of colossal stone heads, as well as significant advances in art and urban development.

8. **Nubians**: The Kingdom of Kush, located to the south of Egypt in what is now Sudan, thrived from around 1070 BCE to 350 CE. The Nubians developed their own distinct culture, with significant achievements in architecture and trade, and at times ruled over Egypt as pharaohs of the 25th Dynasty.

9. [[Akkadians]]: Flourishing from around 2334 to 2154 BCE in [[Mesopotamia]], the Akkadian Empire, founded by Sargon of Akkad, is notable for being one of the world’s first empires and for spreading the Akkadian language and culture throughout the region.

10. **Hittites**: From around 1600 to 1178 BCE in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Hittites established an influential empire known for its interactions with neighboring civilizations and contributions to early legal codes and military organization.
