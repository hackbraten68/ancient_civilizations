**Location**: Southeastern Turkey, near Şanlıurfa

**Discovery Period**: Discoveries began in 1997 and continue to be explored.

**Summary**: Karahan Tepe is a notable prehistoric site situated in southeastern Turkey, recognized for its monumental architecture and significant archaeological findings. The site features large, circular and oval enclosures, similar to those found at Göbekli Tepe, with massive stone pillars that are intricately carved with various motifs. These structures suggest that the site was used for complex religious and social purposes.

**Significance**: The discovery of Karahan Tepe has profound implications for our understanding of early human societies. The site provides evidence that advanced religious practices and social structures existed much earlier than previously thought. Like Göbekli Tepe, Karahan Tepe challenges traditional views of the development of organized religion and complex social systems, indicating that such elements emerged during the Neolithic period, long before the advent of agriculture.

**Current Research**: Ongoing excavations at Karahan Tepe aim to further uncover the extent of the site’s use and its role in the broader context of prehistoric Anatolia. The findings continue to contribute to a re-evaluation of the timeline and nature of early human civilization.
